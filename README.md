## Setup

### Installing via Smithery

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install buryhuang/mcp-hubspot --client claude
```

### Prerequisites

You'll need a HubSpot access token. You can obtain this by:
1. Creating a private app in your HubSpot account:
   Follow the [HubSpot Private Apps Guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/private-apps/overview)
   - Go to your HubSpot account settings
   - Navigate to Integrations > Private Apps
   - Click "Create private app"
   - Fill in the basic information:
     - Name your app
     - Add description
     - Upload logo (optional)
   - Define required scopes:
     - tickets
     - crm.objects.contacts.write
     - crm.objects.contacts.sensitive.read
     - crm.objects.companies.sensitive.read
     - sales-email-read
     - crm.objects.deals.sensitive.read
     - crm.objects.companies.write
     - crm.objects.companies.read
     - crm.objects.deals.read
     - crm.objects.deals.write
     - crm.objects.contacts.read
   - Review and create the app
   - Copy the generated access token

Note: Keep your access token secure and never commit it to version control.

### Docker Installation

You can either build the image locally or pull it from Docker Hub. The image is built for the Linux platform.

#### Supported Platforms
- Linux/amd64
- Linux/arm64

#### Option 1: Pull from Docker Hub
```bash
docker pull buryhuang/mcp-hubspot:latest
```

#### Option 2: Build Locally
```bash
docker build -t mcp-hubspot .
```

Run the container:
```bash
docker run \
  -e HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here \
  buryhuang/mcp-hubspot:latest
```

You can also pass the access token directly as a command-line argument:

```bash
docker run \
  buryhuang/mcp-hubspot:latest \
  --access-token your_access_token_here
```

## Cross-Platform Publishing

To publish the Docker image for multiple platforms, you can use the `docker buildx` command. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a new builder instance** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   docker buildx create --use
   ```

2. **Build and push the image for multiple platforms**:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t buryhuang/mcp-hubspot:latest --push .
   ```

3. **Verify the image is available for the specified platforms**:
   ```bash
   docker buildx imagetools inspect buryhuang/mcp-hubspot:latest
   ```
